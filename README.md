<h2> Examples </h2>

<h3> 1. Vortex suppression through conjugate heat transfer </h3>

<p align="justify"> <font size="4"> 
Formation of von K치rm치n vortices behind bluff and aerodynamic bodies in a fluid flow generate structural vibrations which, especially at high Reynolds number can lead to disastrous consequences. These counter-rotating vortices are not uncommon and can easily form around objects like buildings, powerplant equipments, aircrafts, ships and submarines. The magnitude of damages is directly proportional to the frequency of vortex release which increases with the flow speed.

<p align="justify"> <font size="4"> 
From an engineering perspective, it is important to study the effect of their behavior during design stages and find a way to mitigate them. One way is to suppress the frequency of vortex release through conjugate heat transfer from the body itself. For example, consider a two-dimensional case of a solid cylinder placed inside a channel flow at Re = 1000. <b>Fig 1(a)</b> shows the vorticity contours with clock-wise and counter clock-wise behavior. Now, when the surface of this cylinder starts to heat up we see that these counter-rotating vortices begin to dissipate as shown in <b>Fig 1 (b) & (c)</b> . The vortex release frequency reduces with increase in temperature and at higher temperatures the von K치rm치n vortices completely disappear as in <b>Fig 1 (d)</b>. 
</font> </p>

<p align="justify"> <font size="4">
This behavior can be explained by observing the temperature and density distribution inside the fluid. <b>Fig 2</b> shows contoured distribution of these properties for one such case. As temperature inside the fluid increases it undergoes thermal expansion which leads to a decrease in density, this causes a reduction in local Reynolds number thus suppressing the vortex formation in the wake region.

<h3> 2. Lid Driven Cavity </h3>

</b> </font> </p>

<p align="justify"> <font size="4">
Lid driven cavity is a traditional benchmark problem where the top wall is free slip and moves at a speed <i>U</i> and the remaining three walls are no slip. These conditions lead to interesting vortex patterns which depend on the Reynolds number. This test case is used here to validate the numerical results with reference data.

<h3> 3. Conjugate heat transfer between fluid and multiple immersed boundaries </h3>

<p align="justify"> <font size="4">
This example is to show the capability of software in handling multiple immersed boundaries. The test case here shows temperature distribution inside the fluid due to the presence of three heated cylinders.

This type of situation is typically found in heat-exchangers and nuclear reactors and can be further understood using simulation tools.

<p align="justify"> <font size="4">
The new MPI-3 library enables use of shared memory parallelization for processes on the same node. Whether you are running simulation on a multi-node cluster or a single MIC (Many Integrated Cores) processor you can use shared memory intra-node and distributed memory inter-node. Experimental tests for this software show that MPI shared memory parallelization gives almost twice as much speed up in comparison to traditional distributed memory model.
